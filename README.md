# Pocket Telemetry 
### It should be Karting Track Data Collector but...
### ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Overview
This application is designed to provide real-time tracking and data collection for karting enthusiasts. Utilizing the sensors available on a standard smartphone, the app collects GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope and compass data to offer insights into racing performance on the karting track. If you can process the raw data. Ha-ha-ha.

## Features
- **Sensor Data Collection**: Gathers data from built-in sensors, including the accelerometer, gyroscope, compass and GPS, to analyze racing dynamics.
- **Customizable Data Collection**: Users can adjust the frequency of sensor updates and data dumping intervals according to their specific needs. But only in the code of application!
- **Efficient Data Management**: Data is efficiently collected and stored locally, with options to export for detailed analysis.

## Usage
To use the application, launch it on your smartphone and configure the settings according to your preference. Start a new race to begin data collection. The app will display your current session on the main screen where you can:
- Start/Stop data collection
- View past sessions
- Export data for offline analysis
